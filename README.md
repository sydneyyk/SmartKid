# SmartKid
BisonHacks2020 Project

This repository hosts the APIs which make SmartKid the all in one educational app. SmartKid is an interactive tool that allows children to learn more about the community around them as well as ways to make a change in that area. Kids can use the camera on their tablet to scan buildings and learn the historical background of that area. The app also offers event suggestions for children to find nearby places to volunteer. Finally, there is a game section for students to play and reinforce the knowledge they gained while using the app.
